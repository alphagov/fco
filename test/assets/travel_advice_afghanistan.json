It warned Afghan civilians to avoid large public gatherings, military bases, convoys and ministries belonging to the government of Afghanistan.<br><br>You should be aware of the continuing high threat from terrorism within Afghanistan. Threats, specific or otherwise, are reported on an almost daily basis. Terrorists and insurgents conduct frequent and widespread lethal attacks against British and Coalition armed forces, political and civilian targets.<br><br>We continue to receive reports which indicate specific terrorist threats against visibly British and western institutions, organisations and individuals. Threats also apply to those involved in work with the United Nations as well as those working in the humanitarian and reconstruction fields. Attacks throughout Afghanistan have included bombs (roadside and other), suicide bombs (either on foot or by vehicle), indirect fire (rockets and mortars), direct fire attacks (shootings and rocket propelled grenades), kidnappings and violent crime.<br><br>You should also remain constantly aware of the risks posed by the large amounts of unexploded bombs and land mines (both anti-tank and anti-personnel) throughout the country.<br><br>You should also be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets including places frequented by foreigners. See our \u201c<a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/staying-safe/terrorism\">Terrorism Abroad</a>\u201d page. <br><br>Additional vigilance and care should be taken, particularly in and around landmark locations and places where large public crowds can gather. Hotels (used by the Government of Afghanistan and western nationals), ministries, and military establishments have been attacked in the past and there is always the possibility that there may be further such attacks.

You are advised to exercise the utmost care, vary routines and not set regular patterns of movement whilst travelling. You should take professional security advice whilst in country. Outside of Kabul you should consider the use of permanent armed protection and armoured vehicles.<br></p>\n<p>\nThe possible kidnapping of two German nationals and a US civilian in the Kabul area highlights the dangers of robbery and forced abduction within Afghanistan. \u00a0Whilst kidnap of local nationals is an ongoing concern, the recent events indicate an increase in the activity in relation to foreign nationals. \u00a0Further abductions may occur over the coming months therefore individuals must ensure that they have adequate security provision when visiting Afghanistan and maintain their personal security regime at all times.<br><br>You should be aware that the long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.<br><br>Since 2001, a number of international people have been kidnapped, both by terrorists and criminals. A documentary film-maker was kidnapped in May 2008 near the Pakistan border (subsequently released in Pakistan), a journalist was kidnapped in September 2009 in Kunduz (rescued after being held captive for a few days) and an aid worker was kidnapped in Kunar in September 2010 and killed during a rescue operation on 09 October.<br><br>See our <a href=\"#\">victims of crime abroad</a> page.<br><br><b style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Safety and Security - Local Travel</b><br>If you remain in Afghanistan, particularly outside Kabul, you should continue to reassess your situation. You should exercise the utmost care and vary your routines. You should always ensure car doors are locked and windows closed, and if possible maintain radio, or telephone, communications to report your movements. We advise you to avoid any protests, demonstrations and large gatherings. Visitors/workers are advised not to set regular patterns of movement whilst travelling in the city and to ensure they take professional security advice whilst in country. <br><br>You should avoid regular visits to public places frequented by foreigners, including hotels, restaurants, shops and market places, especially at times of day when they are particularly busy and congested. The British Embassy does not currently allow official visitors to stay in any hotels overnight, and has placed less well protected restaurants off limits to staff. We recommend that you regularly check this travel advice for information on the security situation in Afghanistan before undertaking any travel. In addition we advise that you register with our <a title=\"LOCATE\" href=\"https://www.locate.fco.gov.uk/misper/\">LOCATE</a> service. This will allow you to receive regular advice and information on specific and urgent threats.<br><br>If, despite this advice, you travel outside Kabul, you should only do so with reputable local guides and only to fully protected workplaces. You should consider permanent armed protection and use armoured vehicles. You should be aware that even these precautions cannot guarantee your safety. The threat from kidnapping, suicide bombs, roadside bombs, indirect fire and ambush throughout Afghanistan remains.<br><b style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><br>Safety and Security - Local Travel - Road Travel</b><br>Road travel remains highly dangerous. Deployments of false vehicle checkpoints from which violent attacks have been mounted are methods insurgents have used in the past. In addition to the threat from terrorism/ kidnapping, there is also a continuing criminal threat from car-jacking and robbery. <br><br>If travelling by road you should only travel in secure transport with close protection, using reputable local drivers and guides. In many areas you should consider the use of armoured vehicles. Most road surfaces are in a very poor condition. The overall standard of driving is poor and most local drivers are uninsured.

Hotels and other guest-houses where foreigners stay continue to be likely targets. There are specific threats against the major Ministry and Government buildings. There have been indirect fire attacks against Kabul International Airport and further attacks cannot be ruled out.<br><br>Kabul City witnessed a significant escalation in the number of suicide and rocket attacks between summer 2009 and summer 2010. During this period, there were fourteen 'successful' suicide attacks in the City, with at least five further suicide attacks known to have been thwarted. Of these fourteen attacks, eight were directed against the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), including an attack on their main headquarters in Shash Darak. The remainder of attacks have been conducted against a variety of targets including: an Embassy (Indian); the UN (a guesthouse); an international hotel (the Heetal); an international guesthouse (Noor); a private security company compound; and a large complex attack against multiple ministries on 18 January 2010. Since summer 2010, the rate of attacks has reduced, mainly due to a high rate of operations against INS in Kabul City and in eastern Afghanistan. \u00a0However, the continuing attacks, mainly at the edge of the city and the attack at the \u2018Finest\u2019 supermarket on 28 Jan 2011 demonstrate that the threat of attacks in Kabul remains extant.<br><br>You should exercise extreme caution if you intend to use the Jalalabad and Airport roads and you should avoid travelling at night and between the hours of 07:00 and 09:00 if at all possible. \n</p>\n<p>\nClick <a title=\"Afghanistan-recent-significant-attacks2\" href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/content/en/travel-advice/asia-oceana/12390706/Afghanistan-recent-significant-attacks2\">here</a> to see details of recent significant attacks.<br>\u00a0 \n</p>\n<p>\n\n\t<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><b>Safety and Security - Regional Travel<br></b></span>For any trip to Afghanistan you should carefully consider not only your final destination, but your entry and exit points and any Provinces you might be travelling through.

It is difficult to categorise the country as a whole due to its diverse geography, combined with ethnic, tribal and religious differences set in the context of an ongoing insurgency. Large parts of the East, South East and South of the country are affected by conflict. Other areas have seen steady improvements in security, but are still prone to terrorist attacks and a high crime rate, including Kabul City. There are also parts of the country where security is better, terrorist attacks are far less likely and crime rates are lower, such as Panjshir Valley, Bamyan and the Wakhan Corridor. <br><a title=\"FCO_CP_Afghanistan\" href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/asia-oceania/afghanistan/\"><br>Country Profile: Afghanistan</a><strong><br></strong>\n</p>","plain":"\n\n\tSafety and Security - Terrorism\r\nOn 30 April the Taliban issued a press release announcing that a Spring offensive named \u2018Operation Badr\u2019 was to begin on the 1 May. It warned Afghan civilians to avoid large public gatherings, military bases, convoys and ministries belonging to the government of Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nYou should be aware of the continuing high threat from terrorism within Afghanistan. Threats, specific or otherwise, are reported on an almost daily basis. Terrorists and insurgents conduct frequent and widespread lethal attacks against British and Coalition armed forces, political and civilian targets.\r\n\r\nWe continue to receive reports which indicate specific terrorist threats against visibly British and western institutions, organisations and individuals. Threats also apply to those involved in work with the United Nations as well as those working in the humanitarian and reconstruction fields. Attacks throughout Afghanistan have included bombs (roadside and other), suicide bombs (either on foot or by vehicle), indirect fire (rockets and mortars), direct fire attacks (shootings and rocket propelled grenades), kidnappings and violent crime.\r\n\r\nYou should also remain constantly aware of the risks posed by the large amounts of unexploded bombs and land mines (both anti-tank and anti-personnel) throughout the country.\r\n\r\nYou should also be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets including places frequented by foreigners. See our \u201cTerrorism Abroad\u201d page. \r\n\r\nAdditional vigilance and care should be taken, particularly in and around landmark locations and places where large public crowds can gather. Hotels (used by the Government of Afghanistan and western nationals), ministries, and military establishments have been attacked in the past and there is always the possibility that there may be further such attacks. The British Embassy does not currently allow official visitors to stay in any hotels overnight, and has placed less well protected restaurants off limits to staff.\r\n\r\nSafety and Security - Kidnap\r\nThe risk of being kidnapped throughout Afghanistan remains a constant and real threat. You are advised to exercise the utmost care, vary routines and not set regular patterns of movement whilst travelling. You should take professional security advice whilst in country. Outside of Kabul you should consider the use of permanent armed protection and armoured vehicles.\r\n\n\nThe possible kidnapping of two German nationals and a US civilian in the Kabul area highlights the dangers of robbery and forced abduction within Afghanistan. \u00a0Whilst kidnap of local nationals is an ongoing concern, the recent events indicate an increase in the activity in relation to foreign nationals. \u00a0Further abductions may occur over the coming months therefore individuals must ensure that they have adequate security provision when visiting Afghanistan and maintain their personal security regime at all times.\r\n\r\nYou should be aware that the long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.\r\n\r\nSince 2001, a number of international people have been kidnapped, both by terrorists and criminals. A documentary film-maker was kidnapped in May 2008 near the Pakistan border (subsequently released in Pakistan), a journalist was kidnapped in September 2009 in Kunduz (rescued after being held captive for a few days) and an aid worker was kidnapped in Kunar in September 2010 and killed during a rescue operation on 09 October.\r\n\r\nSee our victims of crime abroad page.\r\n\r\nSafety and Security - Local Travel\r\nIf you remain in Afghanistan, particularly outside Kabul, you should continue to reassess your situation. You should exercise the utmost care and vary your routines. You should always ensure car doors are locked and windows closed, and if possible maintain radio, or telephone, communications to report your movements. We advise you to avoid any protests, demonstrations and large gatherings. Visitors/workers are advised not to set regular patterns of movement whilst travelling in the city and to ensure they take professional security advice whilst in country. \r\n\r\nYou should avoid regular visits to public places frequented by foreigners, including hotels, restaurants, shops and market places, especially at times of day when they are particularly busy and congested. The British Embassy does not currently allow official visitors to stay in any hotels overnight, and has placed less well protected restaurants off limits to staff. We recommend that you regularly check this travel advice for information on the security situation in Afghanistan before undertaking any travel. In addition we advise that you register with our LOCATE service. This will allow you to receive regular advice and information on specific and urgent threats.\r\n\r\nIf, despite this advice, you travel outside Kabul, you should only do so with reputable local guides and only to fully protected workplaces. You should consider permanent armed protection and use armoured vehicles. You should be aware that even these precautions cannot guarantee your safety. The threat from kidnapping, suicide bombs, roadside bombs, indirect fire and ambush throughout Afghanistan remains.\r\n\r\nSafety and Security - Local Travel - Road Travel\r\nRoad travel remains highly dangerous. Deployments of false vehicle checkpoints from which violent attacks have been mounted are methods insurgents have used in the past. In addition to the threat from terrorism/ kidnapping, there is also a continuing criminal threat from car-jacking and robbery. \r\n\r\nIf travelling by road you should only travel in secure transport with close protection, using reputable local drivers and guides. In many areas you should consider the use of armoured vehicles. Most road surfaces are in a very poor condition. The overall standard of driving is poor and most local drivers are uninsured. Accidents may lead to a confrontation and threatening behaviour.\r\n\r\nSee our driving abroad page.\r\n\r\nSafety and Security - Local Travel - Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) \r\nThe Afghanistan NGO Safety Office (ANSO) issues regular security updates for NGOs. Please consult their website for further information.\r\n\n\nSafety and Security - Local Travel - In Kabul \r\n\r\nWe advise against all travel to the Surobi, Paghman, Musayhi, Khak-e Jabbar and Chahar Asyab Districts of Kabul province.   \nWe advise against all but essential travel to Kabul City itself and the remaining districts in the province.\r\n\n\nThere are regular, indiscriminate rocket and bomb attacks in the city and targeted attacks against ISAF patrols and establishments. Reports continue to indicate that further attacks are likely against Western targets in central Kabul, and particularly along the Jalalabad Road, the Airport Road,\u00a0the Wardak road and in the vicinity of Kabul airport. Hotels and other guest-houses where foreigners stay continue to be likely targets. There are specific threats against the major Ministry and Government buildings. There have been indirect fire attacks against Kabul International Airport and further attacks cannot be ruled out.\r\n\r\nKabul City witnessed a significant escalation in the number of suicide and rocket attacks between summer 2009 and summer 2010. During this period, there were fourteen 'successful' suicide attacks in the City, with at least five further suicide attacks known to have been thwarted. Of these fourteen attacks, eight were directed against the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), including an attack on their main headquarters in Shash Darak. The remainder of attacks have been conducted against a variety of targets including: an Embassy (Indian); the UN (a guesthouse); an international hotel (the Heetal); an international guesthouse (Noor); a private security company compound; and a large complex attack against multiple ministries on 18 January 2010. Since summer 2010, the rate of attacks has reduced, mainly due to a high rate of operations against INS in Kabul City and in eastern Afghanistan. \u00a0However, the continuing attacks, mainly at the edge of the city and the attack at the \u2018Finest\u2019 supermarket on 28 Jan 2011 demonstrate that the threat of attacks in Kabul remains extant.\r\n\r\nYou should exercise extreme caution if you intend to use the Jalalabad and Airport roads and you should avoid travelling at night and between the hours of 07:00 and 09:00 if at all possible. \n\n\nClick here to see details of recent significant attacks.\r\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\tSafety and Security - Regional Travel\r\nFor any trip to Afghanistan you should carefully consider not only your final destination, but your entry and exit points and any Provinces you might be travelling through. You should carefully consider how each leg of your trip affects the safety of your overall journey.\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of serious attacks on both western and Afghan Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and on vehicles belonging to them, in which a number of people have been killed or injured. Most attacks continue to occur in the East and South of Afghanistan with a recent increase in activity in the central areas, but there have also been sporadic, but serious, incidents in other regions. A high threat from kidnapping to employees of NGOs and foreign companies throughout Afghanistan remains. \r\n\r\nSafety and Security - Local Travel - Northern Afghanistan\r\nProvinces covered in this section are - Badakhshan, Baghlan, Balkh, Faryab, Jawzjan, Kunduz, Samangan, Sari Pul and Takhar.\r\n\nWe advise against all but essential travel to Takhar, Faryab, Jawzjan, Samangan, Sari Pul andthe remainder of Baghlan.\r\n\nWe advise against all travel to Balkh, Kunduz, Badakhshan and Baghram-e Jidad District of Baghlan.\r\n\n\nThere have been a number of attacks against aid workers and military vehicles resulting in deaths and injuries. There are ongoing military operations throughout the Northern Region.\r\n\n\nWe continue to advise against all travel to Badakhshan, including travelling to or climbing and trekking within the Wakhan Corridor, given the significant security risks in the region and the Wakhan Corridor's geographical isolation.\r\n\r\nClick\u00a0here to see details of recent significant attacks. \n\n\n\n\tSafety and Security - Local Travel - Eastern Afghanistan\r\nProvinces covered in this section are Bamiyan, Ghazni, Kapisa, Khost, Kunar, Laghman, Logar, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Paktika, Panjshir, Parwan, Paktya and Wardak.\r\n\r\n\nWe advise against all travel to Ghazni, Kapisa, Khost, Kunar, Laghman, Logar, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Paktika, Wardak and Paktya. \r\n\nWe advise against all but essential travel to Bamiyan and Parwan. \n\n\r\nThe Eastern Region has been extremely volatile for some time, with almost daily suicide and roadside bomb attacks, shootings and rocket attacks.
